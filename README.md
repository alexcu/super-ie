Help _Super Internet Explorer_ collect as many web pages as you can before the
evil Recycling Bins try and gobble you up to uninstall your uselessness!

The aim of the game is to navigate through a maze of programs (`Block`s) and push these blocks around to help evade the evil Recycling Bins. Collect all the web pages (`Coin`s) on the screen, and when you collect all the web pages, escape to the desktop (`Target`) that will randomly appear. Get there as soon as you can before can before the evil Recycling Bins get you!

## Disclaimer

This is a simple demo game for the purposes of educating how to make a simple game. It was intended to demonstrate the dynamics of creating a maze-style game with undo functionality, and was put together **very quickly**. As such, there are memory leaks and it has room for improvement. This said, contributions and bugs found are most welcome! :)
